<h4 style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center;">When i have a leisure time, i will go for hiking, joging, playing badminton and exercise at lake that near from my house. Actually, if you can see in this photo that shown the view of panaroma from Panaroma Hill. This is my first time hiking at this hill. Before this i just hiking at Pelindung Hill with my friends. This hill quite risky and dangerous to climb and hilly. It takes around 40 minutes to reach to the top of the hill. For me when we reached at the top of the hill, it is the moment to see the beautiful view which is sunset. I recommend for those who want to hiking, please take a breakfast first to prevent faint, vomiting or cramps.</h4>

<div style="border-style: solid; background-color:white; width: 60%; margin: auto;">
<h4 style="font-family: sans-serif; text-align: center;">Last semester break, my mom pursuade me to do part time job as sales girl at Kedai Emas Sham in Kuantan, the shop is near from my house. At first i did not want because i afraid with that work that's quite risky and especially i don't have any experiences as sales girl in promoting gold and jewellery. So i made decisions to give a try and do my part time job as sales girl at that shop in a month while waiting my next semester. Overall this job quite fun and interesting even though at first i felt pressure with the new environment in handling customer. The salary that i got also worth it. This kind of experience, for me is quite expensive because a few shop did not want worker that don't have any experienced in gold and jewellery. So i'm grateful i'm the one who got selected to work there.</h4>
